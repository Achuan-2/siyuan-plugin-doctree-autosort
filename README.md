# Custom Sort Automation

## Background

If Siyuan Notes' document tree is sorted by document name, it lacks the freedom and flexibility I desire. Therefore, I usually opt for custom sorting. However, in custom sorting mode, manually dragging each document to sort by file name can be quite cumbersome. It would be great to have a sorting feature on top of custom sorting. This would allow me to create documents in any order, focusing on creation, and then sort them by document name later to achieve an organized note hierarchy.

## Features

When the document tree sorting mode is set to custom sorting, the plugin will add a sorting button to the right-click menu of parent documents and notebooks in the document tree for sorting. Currently, only sequential sorting is supported.
